# CS 4730 Operating Systems Projects

This repository contains three projects completed as part of the CS 4730 Operating Systems course. Each project is written in the C programming language.

## Project 1: FileSystem - EXT-2 File System Simulator

The FileSystem project is an EXT-2 File System Simulator. It provides a simulated environment for understanding and working with the EXT-2 file system. 
This project includes functionalities related to file creation, deletion, modification, and directory operations. Users can interact with the file system through a command-line interface.

## Project 2: MultiProcess - Word Count using Multi-Process Programming

The MultiProcess project demonstrates the advantages of using multi-process programming to count a large number of words from a text file. 
It creates multiple processes to efficiently process the file concurrently, showcasing the benefits of parallelism in word counting.

## Project 3: MultiThreadServer - Multi-Threaded Web Server

The MultiThreadServer project implements a multi-threaded architecture with a thread pool to efficiently handle multiple requests in a web server. 
This project showcases the benefits of using multithreading to handle concurrent connections and improve overall server performance.
